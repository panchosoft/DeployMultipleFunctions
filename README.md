# Deploying a Solution with Multiple Function Apps to Azure
This repository demonstrates how to deploy a solution with multiple function apps into separate Azure Function App services using the power of GitHub Actions. 

The solution can be opened with Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio code and it includes 3 sample function app projects (Liquid, Solid and Solidus) written in C# and .NET 6.0.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code, configuration files, and GitHub Actions workflows in this repository. Use them as references or starting points for your own deployments with multiple function apps.

Name | File | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Deploy All Functions to Azure  | deploy_all_functions.yml  | This action automates the process of building and deploying the three function app projects in the solution to Azure. Optionally, it updates the API Management API endpoints definition based on the projects' configuration using OpenAPI.
Deploy Liquid Functions to Azure | deploy_liquid_functions.yml | This action builds and deploys the Liquid functions app project to Azure. Optionally, it updates the API endpoints definition based on the project configuration (HTTP Trigger with OpenAPI).
Deploy Solid Functions to Azure | deploy_solid_functions.yml  | This action builds and deploys the Solid functions app project to Azure. Optionally, it updates the API endpoints definition based on the project configuration (HTTP Trigger with OpenAPI).
Deploy Solidus Functions to Azure | deploy_solidus_functions.yml  | This action builds and deploys the Solidus functions app project to Azure. Optionally, it updates the API endpoints definition based on the project configuration (HTTP Trigger with OpenAPI).
